## Description
This app was made to perform simple mathematical operations on fractions. A large part of this was to create a Fraction class as part of a library, which can be used to solve fraction computations in both console and graphical applications at th same time.

To that end this App has some large seperate parts:
- A class library containing the Fraction class.
- Unit tests for this Fraction class.
- A console application to demonstrate the basic usage of the class.
- A graphical WPF application to allow the user to solve fractional computations. 

## Author
This App was made by Olivier Westerman while studying at Vives Brugge in Spring 2024.
